For a web developer, learning C may seem like a low-return endevour. Though, I have a suspicion that may not be true. What follows is my best effort in justifying my decision to learn C. After careful thought, I can distil my rationale into philosophical, intellectual, and practical buckets.

## Philosophical Motivation
The modern web is built primarily with one language, JavaScript. On the client side, execptions to this are sparse. The backend is slightly more diverse, with a large presence from languages like Python and Go. The reality though, is that the productity gains of working in JavaScript, full-stack, has propogated it everywhere. This has come to fruition for both econonomic and practical reasons. JavaScript is so popular, that it is employed in places it probably should not be (See Atwood's law).

Perhaps, for the majority of JavaScript developers, the above could be used to justify doubling-down in their JavaScript craft. After all, doing cool stuff is more accessible than ever. JavaScript has immeasurably contributed to the average developer's ability to persue even their most challenging ideas. With the mature, dense ecosystem that JavaScript fosters, it feels like anything is possible.

I think that's great for the majority. Personally, the appeal of JavaScript only exists insofar as it remains the de facto tool used to solve economic problems. If something needs to be built, JavaScript is the default choice. Like many others, I feel like this could eventually change. Regardless, I believe experimentation in and of itself, would prove invaluable. There are enough people moving the world forward with JavaScript. I would contend that having a a critical mass of developers forming new paths will pay dividends some day. We have already seen this manifest in the surge of web-dev tooling being (re)written in Rust. Though, personally, I have no desire to use C in my web-dev workflow.

## Intellectual Motivation
I know two languages well: Python and JavaScript. Obviously, the former I use primarily for web-dev. My first "love" was Python. I picked it up to help me with my data science projects and it quickly revealed a realm of possibility. Unfortunately for me, the two languages are largely redundant. They are both "high-level," interpreted languages. For the most part, they demand the same skill-set to write competent code.

While learning JavaScript during my forray into web-dev, I felt robbed of a "eureka" moment. I didn't feel like I've learned anything susbtantial. The transition from Python to JavaScript was rather seamless. If anything, learning React felt much more empowering.

With C, I have "eureka" moments nearly every time I sit down to learn it. The simplicity of the language necessitates that you **know** what you are doing. It demands you know basic data structures. It demands you know about memory management. There is no garbage collector cleaning up after you. 

It feel so satisfying. I cannot begin to describe how good it feels to see a program successfully compile.

I want to learn C because I know, deep down, that I am lacking in basic CS knowledge. I've never had to think about memory management. I can trivially utilize most of the data structures that I need. Heck, up until recently, I have not even had to think about types!

## Practical Motivation
Learning C is very much a stepping stone. Truthfully, I contemplated learning Rust instead. The reason I chose to learn C **first** can be summarized through the following:
- I've heard a slew of people I look up to mention that struggling with C is invaluable in becoming an excellent programmer.
- I have aspirations to get into robotics and mechanical automation. I know embedded Rust is increasing in popularity, but it seems C remains the clear choice.
- I hope it will make the transition into learning Rust much more manageable.

## Conclusion
With the context built above, here are the "wins" I hope to have by learning C:
- I fill in the massive gaps in my CS knowledge
- I become a better programmer after being exposed to lower-level patterns
- I develop an appreciation for the abstraction provided by JavaScript and Python
- I gain an escape-hatch if I need to write truly performant code

The time seems right for me to make the jump. I have been using TypeScript for a while, and I have gotten used to typing things. I was also an early adopter in Python type-hints. I don't think that provides a sturdy foundation, but it is a foundation nonetheless. I hope this post proves useful to people that find themselves with similar thoughts.
